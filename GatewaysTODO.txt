- API for the service
	= GET api/Gateways - gets the information for all gateways and their devices. --------X
	= POST api/Gateways ---------X
		== adds new gateway, verifies IP, and returns unique serial number. Should the serial number be passed by the request or is it generated by the service? 
		If it is passed by the request it should be verified for uniquenuess!
	= PUT api/Gateways/{serialNumber} 
		== edit Gateway - if this API is implemented the other PUT Gateways api should not have serial number in the url.
	= DELETE api/Gateways/{serialNumber}----------X
	= GET api/Gateways/{serialNumber}/Status? - gets the information about a specific gateway and its devices and statuses -------X
	= PUT api/Gateways/{serialNumber}/Status - update statuses of devices in the gateway -------X
	= POST api/Gateways/{serialNumber}/Devices - adds a peripheral device and returns a uniqueID-----X
	= DELETE api/Gateways/{serialNumber}/Devices/{UID}---------X
	
	!Generally, in practice, always use PUT for UPDATE operations.//Always use POST for CREATE operations.
	
- Clear references to concrete classes in the managers and data access - use only interfaces. --------X

- Move the Exceptions classes to the interfaces project. The exceptions should be independent from the implementation. ------X

- Remove dependancies to Gateways.Management and other implementations of interfaces from the API controllers that use the implementation. --------X

- Make Gateway.Devices return [] instead of null ------X

- Make the connection string a property of the DataAccess class instead of local var in each method. ---------X

- Make IPv4 validator class with static methods?

- Should there be a message for incorrect devices status input when updating statuses?

- Decide between bigint and int for the ids in the database
	= The type in the DB should correspond to the type in the DataModel classes
	
- Use the gateway table uniqueness constraint to check if a gateway already exists during creation of new gateway to avoid calling 2 stored procedures. 
If you try to add a gateway with a serial number which already exists the stored procedure fails with an error.
The controllers should not be dependant of the implementation only the intrefaces.

- Add the ability to add devices to gateway during creation.
